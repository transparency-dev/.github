# Transparency.dev Community Code of Conduct

## Agreement

We as members, contributors, and leaders are committed to fostering a positive
and inclusive environment for all community participants.  We agree to make
participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion (or lack
thereof), or sexual identity and orientation.

We agree to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We understand that constructive
engagement and technical discussion is encouraged, where ideas are shared
respectfully and with an openness to dialogue, but actions that disrupt the
productive exchange of ideas and create a hostile environment are not.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive community environment
include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Approaching disagreements with openness and curiosity, focusing on identifying
  and evaluating trade offs rather than pushing a single idea, and expressing
  challenges concretely with suggestions for improvement
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Non-constructive, repetitive and excessive arguing that derails conversation
* Bad faith criticisms, personal judgements or political attacks
* Trolling, insulting, patronising, disparaging or derogatory comments
* The use of sexualized language, imagery or other material, and sexual
  attention or advances of any kind
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies when participating in any and all transparency.dev
community spaces, both online and offline.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when
appropriate.

## Incident reporting

Anyone who witnesses or is subjected to abusive, harassing or otherwise
unacceptable behavior should contact the transparency.dev community leaders at
transparency-community-admin@googlegroups.com.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident, and all complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. Potential
requirement of no interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited
interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of
time. This includes avoiding such interactions in community spaces as well as
external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including, but
not limited to, sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including, but not limited to, sustained inappropriate behavior,
harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of
individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

In all of the above cases, participants asked to stop any unacceptable behavior
are expected to comply immediately.

If inappropriate behavior occurs at a community event, the community leads and
event organizers may take whatever level of action they deem appropriate, from
warning the offender, to expulsion from the event. Severe breaches may result in
a ban from future community events, or expulsion from the community as a whole.

We are all learning together. This Code of Conduct is subject to change based
upon what we learn as a community.
