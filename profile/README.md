Welcome to transparency.dev, a community dedicated to promoting transparency technologies across various ecosystems and pioneering its integration into new application domains.

Tamper-evident logs are the heart of transparency technology and are relied on by [Certificate Transparency](https://certificate.transparency.dev/), [Sigstore (Supply Chain Security)](https://www.sigstore.dev/), and many other ecosystems. Visit [transparency.dev](https://transparency.dev/) to learn more!

## 🔨 Transparency.dev Projects
