Welcome to transparency.dev, a community dedicated to promoting transparency technologies across various ecosystems and pioneering its integration into new application domains.

Tamper-evident logs are the heart of transparency technology and are relied on by [Certificate Transparency](https://certificate.transparency.dev/), [Sigstore (Supply Chain Security)](https://www.sigstore.dev/), and many other ecosystems. Visit [transparency.dev](https://transparency.dev/) to learn more!

## 🔨 Transparency.dev Projects

This repository hosts critical projects for building end-to-end transparency ecosystems, including:
- [tessera](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera) - a Go library for building tile-based transparency logs
- [tesseract](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tesseract) - An implementation of the Static CT API based on Tessera
- [witness](https://github.com/transparency-dev/witness) - Libraries and binaries for running witnesses for verifiable logs
- [armored-witness](https://github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness) - A plug and play witness solution intended to kick-start a cross-ecosystem witness network
